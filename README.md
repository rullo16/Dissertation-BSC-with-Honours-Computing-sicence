# Deep ReinforcementLearning For NormEmergence in Multi-AgentSystems
Abstract
The purpose of this thesis is to investigate whether deep reinforcement learning can be used in theprocess of norm emergence in multi-agent systems.Multi-agent systems are systems composedof autonomous individuals that interact with it to solve complex problems.Norm emergence re-gards the emergence of patterns of behaviours of individuals in a society and has been the subjectof study in a variety of fields,including machine learning.On the other hand,deep reinforce-ment learning applies deep learning techniques such as neural networks to reinforcement learning,where individuals, called agents, interact with an environment and learn by taking actions result-ing in rewards.The application of such a technique to study the behavioural patterns that emergein societies can provide exciting results to understand better how societies function.Traditionalnorm emergence techniques involve a third party in the learning process that coordinates and en-force rules whenever a conflicting state takes place, limiting the autonomy of such agents.Deepreinforcement learning makes the process of learning such rules more natural. Here agents recog-nise erroneous states and decide to adopt a behaviour to avoid them. Such a process makes agentslearn rules instead of imposing them by also coordinating the agents through a rewarding systemIn this work,we simulate a road intersection environment where agents can move and interactwith it,here agents need to reach the other side of the intersection withoutcrashing into eachother,doing so results in a positive reward while crashing in a negative one.Over time,agentsstart cooperating to cross the intersection and develop behaviours to solve such a problem allowingthem to obtain the maximum reward possible. Two kinds of deep reinforcement learning methodsare implemented which differs from the use they make of policies(which actions to take in a givensituation): On-policy methods, which closely resemble norm emergence, and Off-policy methods.The entire system is built in Unity,making the entire process similar in building a video-gamelevel.Overall,this thesis provides an interesting view on the application of deep reinforcementlearning in multi-agent systems to study the emergence of behaviours in individuals by showingthat such method yields similar results to traditional techniques and exposes strength and limita-tion of taking such approach in norm emergence and multi-agent systems, by also providing someexamples on how to expand and take further such research.
